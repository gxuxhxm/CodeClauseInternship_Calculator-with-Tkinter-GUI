# Calculator with Tkinter GUI

## Overview
This Python application implements a calculator featuring a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It incorporates a dark-themed UI for improved aesthetics and includes robust error handling to manage scenarios like division by zero, mathematical errors, or syntax errors.

## Technical Details
### Modules Used
- **tkinter:** Utilized as the primary GUI toolkit for Python.
- **random:** Employed to generate random numbers for the calculator.
- **string:** Utilized for character set management to handle user inputs.
- Dark theme colors are applied for visual appeal.

### Implementation
- **Button Click Handling:** The application captures user inputs through button clicks, updating the expression string accordingly.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is implemented to gracefully manage mathematical errors and prevent crashes. This includes division by zero and invalid syntax detection.
- **Dynamic UI:** The UI dynamically adjusts to user inputs, providing real-time feedback and updates.

## Execution
### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python is installed on the machine.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd calculator-app
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Usage
- Users interact with the calculator by clicking numeric and operational buttons.
- The "C" button clears the input field.
- Error messages are displayed in case of division by zero, math errors, or syntax errors.
